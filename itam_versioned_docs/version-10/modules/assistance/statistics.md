Display statistics
==================

Statistics group reports on tickets as well as reports coming from plugins.

Reports can be parameterized on a given time slot.

Reports on tickets
------------------

* **Global:**

  Display general statistics on tickets:

  * Number of opened , solved, late and closed tickets;
  * Average time of processing, resolution, closure and real duration;
  * Number of satisfaction surveys, opened or answered;
  * Average satisfaction.

* **By ticket:**

  Display statistics on tickets items, selected via a dropdown (requester, assigned technician, impact...).

  Table shows following items in four groups:

  * Number of opened , solved, late and closed tickets;
  * Number of opened satisfaction surveys, number of answers and average satisfaction;
  * Average `Take into account` time (duration between ticket opening and first action on ticket, follow-up, task or solution), resolution time or closure time;
  * Real ticket duration, average and total (real duration of allocated technician time for actions relevant for the ticket).
    
* **By hardware characteristics:**

  Displays statistics on computer items defined in associated items of a ticket (for example, model, operating system, motherboard...)

  The table groups the same numbers as defined in statistics by tickets.

  For these two types of reports, the button |stats_item| located on each result line allows to display the statistics as a graphic.

* **By hardware:**

  Display number of tickets assigned to each hardware, sorted by number of tickets.

The option **See graphics**, when available, allows to display result as a pie chart.

.. note::

   When statistics are done on a tree structured item (groups or categories for example), two presentations are available:

   * Normal: all values are displayed
   * Tree: only values at same level are displayed, taking into account the tickets attached to child elements. It is possible to navigate into values tree.
