title: Creating services automatically

Services can be created automatically in several ways:

- When you [create a host manually](../monitoring-hosts/create-host-manually.md) using a [Plugin Pack](../monitoring-basics/plugin-packs.md), and select **Create Services linked to the Template too**, the services for the host will be created automatically.

- Using the [services discovery feature](../discovery/service-discovery.md) to detect services and create them automatically in i-Vertix IT Monitoring.

    - Autodiscovery is done using [Plugin Packs](../monitoring-basics/plugin-packs.md).
