From there you can easily download single report files or multiple report files by:

- clicking the <ImageCounter num={1} disableMargin /> download button while hovering rows

## Report Event List

We have also created an Event List which is useful to understand which reports work and which don't.

![Event List](../../assets/bi/events.png)

The above mentioned [Report List](./bi-viewing-reports#report-list) only lists successful reports while the Event List also shows failed reports.

Failed reports are easily recognizable due to their red background.
To view the error message you can click on the <ImageCounter num={1} disableMargin /> error icon in front.

The <ImageCounter num={2} disableMargin /> settings button takes you directly to the configuration of the job which produced the error.

The <ImageCounter num={3} disableMargin /> info button opens the report template detail dialog.

The last two buttons <ImageCounter num={4} disableMargin /> and <ImageCounter num={5} disableMargin /> open the parameter and receiver configuration used to generate the report.
