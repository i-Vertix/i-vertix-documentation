## Availability reports

The availability reports concerning objects monitored via the i-Vertix Web interface
can display the availability rates of hosts, a hostgroup, or a servicegroup over a selected period.

To access the availability reports:

- Go to **Reporting > Availability > Hosts**.
- Select a host from the **Host** list in the upper left.

- The **Host state** table displays the availability rates of objects.
