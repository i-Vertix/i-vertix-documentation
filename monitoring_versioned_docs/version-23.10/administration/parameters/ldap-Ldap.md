To configure LDAP integration in i-Vertix IT Monitoring, you typically need to provide the following information:

* LDAP server address and port

* LDAP search base and search filter to specify where to look for users and groups

* LDAP bind user and password, which i-Vertix IT Monitoring uses to connect to the LDAP server for queries

* Mapping of LDAP attributes to i-Vertix IT Monitoring user attributes (e.g., username, email, roles)

LDAP integration in i-Vertix IT Monitoring can vary depending on the specific LDAP server you are using and the requirements of your organization.

Detailed instructions on configuring LDAP integration can be found [i-vertix-ldap](../authentication/ldap.md)
