### Parameters

![Parameters](../assets/bi/jobs_2.png)

*As always, please insert all required fields marked by a checked required checkbox, otherwise saving the job is not available*

:::note

Settings parameters is only available after the Report Template was selected in the [Job Information](./bi-job#job-information)

:::

You will find a list of report parameters that can/need to be set for your report job.
Setting parameters influence what will later be present on the generated report itself.
Some parameters may filter data by f.e. hostgroups/host categories/service groups/service categories or similar.
Other parameters may hide or show additional content on the report.

:::info

Some parameters depend on other parameter values that act like a pre-filter.
You will be notified if other parameters need to be set first when editing parameter values.

:::

To set parameter values, click into the `Value` column of the desired parameter you want to set.

:::tip

Always read the parameter description to find out what the parameter will be used for!

:::

Types of parameter inputs:

- **Text input:** free text input
- **Number input:** special input that only allows numbers
- **Checkbox**: used for true/falsy values
- **Select box**: choose one or more values from the provided options - can be reliant on dependencies
- **Special metric input**: special input to select metrics, acts like a select box but can be tranformed to a regex input along with a regex-matching tool

### Receivers

*configuring receivers is optional*

By setting Receivers you can configure who will receive the generated reports by this report job.
At the moment, only `Email Receivers` are available, thus generated reports can only be sent to users via email.

You will find a list of all available already configured receivers which can be selected by clicking on the checkbox.

You also have the possibility to create a new receiver configuration by clicking the blue `+ Add New Email Receiver` button on top of the list.

<details>
<summary>Create a new email receiver</summary>

![Create a new email receiver](../assets/bi/jobs_3_dialog.png)

2. Choose one of the pre-configured receiver templates (on the big textbox below you will se a preview of the text sent to the recipient)
3. Add email addresses who will receive the mail with the report files attached
4. *(optional)* Add email addresses who will receive a CC of the mail with the report files attached

After you have filled in all required information you can save the new receiver.

</details>

<details>
<summary><i>(only for admins)</i> Create a new email receiver template</summary>

### Schedule

![Schedule Tab](../assets/bi/jobs_4.png)

*scheduling a report job is optional*

On this last part of creating a new report job the scheduling can be configured.
Scheduling a job is optional - if a job is not scheduled executing is only available manually from the job list.

There are multiple ways to schedule a job:

- using the default daily execution
- using the default weekly execution
- using the default monthly execution
- adding custom execution configurations

---

#### Default Executions

Not all default execution types are always available because not every report template is designed to run on a daily/weekly/monthly basis.

This means, that if f.e. the daily scheduling is not available, the report job should also not be scheduled on a daily basis using custom executions.

**Example**:

In the above exmaple image the default monthly scheduling is selected and the slider is set to 3m (3 months) of data.
This means that the report will run on every 1st day of the month and includes the last 3 months of data.
Let's pretend it's the 1st of July: the generated report would contain data from the 1st of April **until** (exclusive)
the 1st of July - so practically all the data from April, May and June.

The same principle is also valid for the other default schedule types.

---

#### Custom Executions

![Custom Scheduling](../assets/bi/jobs_5_custom_predefined.png)

It is also possible to add custom execution configurations:

- <ImageCounter num={1} /> Create a new custom execution
- <ImageCounter num={2} /> Select already pre-defined custom executions

<details>
<summary><ImageCounter num={1} /> Create a new custom execution using the wizard</summary>

1. Choose a schedule when the report job will be executed
    
    ![Choose a schedule](../assets/bi/jobs_4_custom_1.png)

2. Choose the timestamp of data used in the report

    ![Choose a schedule](../assets/bi/jobs_4_custom_2.png)

3. Choose a descriptive name to identify the custom execution

    ![Choose a schedule](../assets/bi/jobs_4_custom_3.png)

4. Review and save your custom execution

    ![Choose a schedule](../assets/bi/jobs_4_custom_4.png)

</details>

---

#### Change the execution time

It is possible to change the execution time of the report job by changing the value in the `Execution time (Timezone)` input.
Keep in mind that the configured time corresponds to the time of the display timezone in the input's label.

---

#### Pause/Resume scheduling

It is possible to pause and resume all configured job schedules without removing current schedule configurations.

<details>
<summary>Pause</summary>

![Pause job](../assets/bi/jobs_4_pause.png)

Press button <ImageCounter num={1} /> `Pause` to pause scheduling.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Resume</summary>

![Resume job](../assets/bi/jobs_4_resume.png)

Press button <ImageCounter num={1} /> `Resume` to resume scheduling.

</details>

:::tip

You are now ready to save your first job. Press the `Save` button on the top right corner above the tabs to save the job.
If the save button is not available you might wanna check if something is still missing.

:::

## Manually execute Report Jobs

![Job List](../assets/bi/jobs_actions.png)

While hovering over report jobs in the job list, following actions will be available:

- <ImageCounter num={1} /> Execute the job
- <ImageCounter num={2} /> Pause/Resume the job's scheduling
- <ImageCounter num={3} /> Delete the job
- <ImageCounter num={4} /> Duplicate the job

We will now take a look at **executing the job**.

After clicking the execute icon

- the job is directly started
- the below popover appears

![Popover Period](../assets/bi/jobs_manual_execution_1.png)

The betold popover is used to configure, who of your <ImageCounter num={2} /> **receivers** should
receive the generated reports and which <ImageCounter num={1} /> **period of data** should be used in the report.

To select the <ImageCounter num={1} /> period of data used in the report you have the possibility to choose between
defined periods or a custom date. You can enter a custom date by switching to `Use custom date`.

![Popover Custom date](../assets/bi/jobs_manual_execution_2.png)

Here you will need to enter <ImageCounter num={1} disableMargin /> <strong>from</strong> which
date (time 00:00) <ImageCounter num={2} disableMargin /> <strong>to</strong> which date (time 00:00) the data will be utilized.

:::note

In the [next article](./bi-viewing-reports) you will learn about how to access generated reports from report jobs.
