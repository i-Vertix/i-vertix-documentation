It's purpose is to collect and transform data into readable and structured reports.

... maybe something with C-level reports to help making critical decisions or whatever

1. **the i-Vertix Business Intelligence monitoring module**: installed on the monitoring instance and used to manage, configure and schedule reports as well as manage installed report templates.
