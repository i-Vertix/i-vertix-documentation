## Installation

The pre-configured i-Vertix Business Intelligence instance is available in OVA format for VMware environments. Please contact our support ([support@i-vertix.com](mailto:support@i-vertix.com)) if you want your system to run on other environments.

:::info

If you need help on how to import the OVA into your VMware environment, please have a look at our [How to import a Virtual appliance](../installation/setup-central-poller/import-virtual-appliance#downloading-the-virtual-machine) documentation

:::

## Configure your system

After completing the virtual machine import and configuration, start the newly created virtual machine.

After the startup-process is completed, log into the command line of the i-Vertix BI system (also with SSH on port 22) with following default credentials:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `changeme`

:::danger

Change the default password as soon as possible to prevent unauthorised access on your system!

what next? Run setup.sh on bi instance, retrieve API key, install extension on monitoring central system, open bi settings (administration/i-vertix/business intelligence) to access bi setup wizard, guide through setup wizard (images already ready), finished -> link to next step (report store)
