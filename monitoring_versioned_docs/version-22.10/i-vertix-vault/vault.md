## VAULT

Vault is a function of i-Vertix IT Monitoring that acts as an internal password safe.


The i-Vertix Vault will be used by the following features:

- NEDI Discovery
- Network Discovery
- OS Discovery
- VMWare

For example:

![vault](../../version-22.10/assets/vault/vault.gif)

In the i-Vertix 22.10 version, all credentials are merged into i-Vertix Vault (shared).

As new credentials are added, they will be added to the repository for use when needed.

The functionality is subject to ACLs
