:::info
This guide requires your system to be on version 4.2. If you need to upgrade from an older version, please contact us via support@i-vertix.com.
:::

## Prerequisites

:::warning
Before attempting any Update, please make sure to create a snapshot or a backup
of your i-Vertix Central Virtual Machine and any other Machine involved.

A reliable Internet connection is also needed, both from Central and Pollers.
:::


## Update Central Server

### Prepare the Upgrade

Start by logging in the system using ssh.
The user needs to be able to run commands with sudo.

The first operation is to install the upgrade package with:

```
sudo dnf install ivertix-ansible-playbooks
```

![dnf install](../assets/upgrade/upgrade-from_4.2/dnf_install.png)


### Perform Upgrade Step 1

Run:
```
sudo ansible-playbook /opt/i-vertix/scripts/ansible/upgrade-central-42-to-43-step1.yaml
```
to really start the upgrade.

Since the scripts update the entire system and download many packages, 
the process may take up to 45 minutes or longer, depending on the speed of your Internet connection.


### Perform Application Upgrade

After the first system update, it is time for the WebUI.
Using a browser, visit the Central WebPage and follow the wizard clicking next and finish.

![webui_5](../assets/upgrade/upgrade-from_4.2/webui_step5.png)

</details>

Then, login in the Central and visit

<Breadcrumb crumbs={["Administration", "Extensions", "Manager"]} />

![administration extensions manager](../assets/upgrade/upgrade-from_4.2/administration_extensions_manager.png)

Click the `Update all` button to update.

When all Extensions are updated, the page should become as follows:

### Perform Upgrade Step 2

Return to the cli and run the next update script:

```
sudo ansible-playbook /opt/i-vertix/scripts/ansible/upgrade-central-42-to-43-step2.yaml
```

![ansible 2](../assets/upgrade/upgrade-from_4.2/ansible_step_2.png)


### Perform Upgrade Step 3

At this point, we need to upgrade the MariaDB database. 
The procedure varies depending on whether the database is embedded (i.e., installed on the same machine as the Central) 
or deployed on a separate server. 
See [Remote Database Management architecture](/monitoring/installation/before-you-start/architecture#dbms)
for more details.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="internal_db" label="Embedded Database" default>

In cases where the database is deployed on the same host as the web application, run:

```
sudo ansible-playbook /opt/i-vertix/scripts/ansible/upgrade-central-42-to-43-step3.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="external_db" label="Separate Database">

If the system architecture has a separate database, we need to run a different upgrade script.
Please contact us at support@i-vertix.com for more information.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Finalize Upgrade

At last, we need to reboot the Central.

```
sudo reboot
```

:::tip
It is strongly suggested to clean the Browser Cache before 
logging in again to avoid errors on the web application.
:::


## Update Pollers
### Perform Automatic Upgrade

After the Central, we need to update all Pollers by running:

```
sudo ansible-playbook /opt/i-vertix/scripts/ansible/upgrade-poller-42-to-43.yaml
```
