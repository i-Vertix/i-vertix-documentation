import Breadcrumb from "../../../src/components/Breadcrumb";

<Breadcrumb crumbs={["Monitoring", "NetFlow", "Historical Flow Analysis"]} />

The *Historical Flow Analysis* can be used to search for older flows, not longer present in the [*Live Flows*](./netflow-live-flows#live-flows) list.
The age of the flows that can be displayed depends on the retention settings. By default flows are stored for 180 days.

You can choose a pre-defined period or select a custom time range. When using a pre-defined period, the data ranges always to the begin of the current hour.

The view can be changed using the *Query* settings at the top left and is separated into two parts:
a timeseries graph and a list, displaying the flows or the relvant information.
