After completing the VM configuration procedure in the chosen hypervisor, **start** the Central Manager and Smart Poller VMs.

The following configuration steps must be performed on both the Central Manager and the Smart Poller.
Startup can take from a few seconds to some minutes.

It is recommended that the startup process is checked through the **hypervisor console**.

Once the VM is started, the following screen with a login prompt will be displayed:

![Login](../../assets/setup-startup-central-poller/first-login-v4.png)

On an **i-Vertix4** system you will need to log into the i-Vertix Monitoring console to configure the network settings, using the following credentials:

- User: '**admin**'

- Password: '**changeme**' (change as soon as possible, see [Password Modification](./password-modification.md))

:::danger

If you fail the login process 3 times, the IP Address will be blocked for 30 minutes (see [fail2ban](../../installation/fail2ban)).

:::

After the authentication, a menu that allows you to configure the next steps is displayed

![iVertix menu](../../assets/setup-startup-central-poller/ivertix-menu-v4.png)

:::info

If the menu doesnâ€™t appear automatically at startup, simply type on the console the command

```bash
menu
```
