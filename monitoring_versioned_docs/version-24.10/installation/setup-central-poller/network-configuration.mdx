Now the network configuration is complete.
Restart the system if necessary. Afterwards the system should be accessible via a network connection (for example using **Putty**).

Check that **DNS** is working

```bash
nslookup www.google.com
```

You should see following or a similar result:

```text
nslookup www.google.com
Server:         192.168.25.2
Address:        192.168.25.2#53
