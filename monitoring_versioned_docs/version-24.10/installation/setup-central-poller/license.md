6. Type `0` to go back to the main menu
7. License status field will change from:

        `License       [ INVALID ]`
        to
        `License       [ VALID ]`

8. Type 2 to reboot the VM so that all the services will be started

The system is now ready. Proceed with the [first access to the web console](../first-web-access/first-web-access.md)
