## Activating the Dashboards feature

Access to the Dashboards feature is not managed at the user level, but through access groups or ACLs (Access Control Lists). You allow users to access the feature by granting rights to the ACL to which they belong (read more [about ACLs](../../managing-users-contacts/acl.md)).

### Configure the ACL

> - You must be logged into the monitoring as an administrator.

- In this example, we will create a new ACL called **Dashboards users**. This ACL will contain users belonging to the **Guests** user group.

1. Go to **Administration > ACL > Menus Access**.
2. Click the **Add** button. This opens the **Add an ACL** form.
3. Name the **ACL Definition**. In this example: **Dashboards users**.
4. Select **Enabled** in the **Status** parameters.
5. Select the **Linked Groups** to include in this ACL. In this example: **Guests**.
6. In the **Accessible Pages** section, expand the **Home** menu, then the **Dashboards** one. This displays the list of profiles to select.

  > - **Viewer:** can only view dashboards to which they have access.
  > - **Creator:** can create and edit dashboards to which they have access.
  > - **Administrator:** can access and edit all dashboards.

7. Select the profile to be set for this ACL. In this example: **Viewer**.
8. Click **Save** to confirm your changes.

## Creating your first dashboard

> You must be logged into the monitoring system with administrator or an user accoutn with creator permissions.

 To create a dashboard, navigate to <Breadcrumb crumbs={["Home", "Dashboards"]} />.

1. In the **Dashboard library** page, click the **Create a dashboard** button. This opens the **Create dashboard** modal.
2. Name the dashboard and enter a description if needed.
3. Click **Create** to confirm the creation.

Your dashboard is now added! You can directly start adding widgets.

### Add widgets

> Your dashboard must be open in edition mode.

- If this is your very first widget, click the **Add a widget** area.
- If not, click the **+ Add a widget** on the right of the interface.

Most of the widgets usually follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Select the type of widget. The widget parameters then depend on the widget you select.
- **Step 2:** Select resources.
- **Step 3:** Select metrics.

 > Make sure to save your changes. If you leave without saving your dashboard, changes will be permanently lost.

### More actions

Click the **three vertical dots** menu at the top right of the widget to edit it or to access more actions:

- Refresh
- Duplicate
- Delete widget

> In edition mode, you can easily organize your widgets by moving or resizing them. Make sure to save your changes.

### Link to Resources Status page

From the dashboard, you can click a screen pictogram at the top right of a widget: this button allows you to **See more on the Resources Status page**. It opens a new tab on the Resources Status page, with detailed information regarding the specific widget.

### Share a dashboard

> You can share dashboards using the **Manage access rights** interface.

#### About access rights

You are using the Dashboards feature with a **viewer** or an **editor** profile:

- **Viewers:** can only view dashboards you share with them.
- **Editors:** can view and edit dashboards you share with them.

#### Manage access rights

5. Repeat the action for each user you want to add.
6. Click the **Update** button to save your changes.

The users you have just added now have access to your dashboard sharing, according to the profile you have set for them.
