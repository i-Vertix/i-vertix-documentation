Notifications by email is the standard way to receive notifications in the i-Vertix monitoring system.

:::note
Be aware that email notifications are sent by the Poller that monitors the host/service resource.
As a result, since emails are sent through the SMTP relay, every Poller you want to use for email notifications,
must have a working SMTP configuration.
:::

:::info[Additional info]
The email *sender address* can and **must be** customized individually on each Poller.
:::

## SMTP Configuration on the Poller

Before configuring email notifications itself, you **must enable** SMTP on every Poller you want to use for email notifications.
Have a look at the documentation on how to [Enable SMTP on a Poller](../../../installation/setup-central-poller/smtp-configuration.md)
in case you did not configure it already.

## Setup email notifications for contacts/contactgroups

Like for any other notification configuration you can follow the general [Configure notification](configuring-notification.md) procedure.
While configuring contacts or contactgroups during the procedure on page <Breadcrumb crumbs={["Configuration", "Users", "Contacts / Users"]} />,
select the notification commands `host-notify-by-email` *(for host email notifications)* and/or 
`service-notify-by-email` *(for service email notifications)* to enable email notifications for the contact/contactgroup.

## Change sender for email notifications

In some cases it is useful to change the sender for the email notifications.
For example, it is needed in the case that the SMTP relay accepts emails only with a given sender.

To change the sender of any email notification for a given Poller, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to <Breadcrumb crumbs={["Configuration", "Pollers", "Engine configuration"]} />

2. Click on the poller for which the address should be changed

To make your changes take effect, export each changed poller configuration and select the method `Restart` for field *Restart Monitoring Engine*.
