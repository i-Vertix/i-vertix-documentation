### Advanced Options

* Devices with coordinates can be placed on i-Vertix Maps, create a [geo map](../../i-vertix-maps/map-types.md) before running the discovery
* Devices can be assigned to custom hostgroups, Network or Organization hostgroups

### Scan Results

Once the scan completes, its **results are displayed**.

They depend on hosts reachability, template rules mapping, API reachability and status filters that have been applied (Note: “new” and “existing (ip)” are applied by default).

![image](../../assets/discovery/meraki5.png)

Different filters are available: **Device, Type, Networks, Device Status, Status, Model, Serial, Tags**.

**Device status** filters are:

* Online
* Offline
* Alerting
* Dormant

**Status** filters are:

* **new**: hosts are highlighted in green. Connection was established and the proper templates were assigned to the hosts. To start monitoring new hosts, select them and click on **ADD TO MONITORING**.
* **existing (ip)**: an host with the **same IP address** had already been detected. The host is likely already being monitored.
* **existing**: an host with the **same IP address and hostname** had already been detected. The host is likely already being monitored.
* **conflict**: an host with the **same hostname** had already been detected, or **the host doesn't have any hostname**. To resolve the conflict, hostname has to be entered or modified.
* **excluded**: the host was excluded from the discovery (**EXCLUDED HOST**).
* **no template assigned**: the host didn’t match any templates. Amend the discovery job and assign a new template rule, or add the host manually.

The result tab displays the hosts that were detected by the discovery, along with the following information:

* **Device name**
* **Type**: Host/device type
* **Model**: Host/device model
* **IP**: Host IP Address
* **Serial**: serial number
* **Network**: the network on which the host is located
* **Templates**: Template(s) assigned to the Host  
* **Status**: Host status

To see Host details, click on it
