## Overview and fast onboarding

Different types of granular discoveries let the user easily filter/select services and hosts that are to be discovered and monitored.

* **Network Topology Discovery**: Layer 2/3 discovery that creates comprehensive network topology maps.

* **Host/Device Discovery**: scans any network, subnet, or IP address.

* **VMware Discovery**: scans VMware environment (Datacenter, Clusters, Hosts, Datastores, VMs, NICs).

* **Cisco Meraki**: discovers cloud Cisco Meraki infrastructures (APs and Switches)

Discovery results are matched with preconfigured monitoring templates to automate monitoring configuration.
