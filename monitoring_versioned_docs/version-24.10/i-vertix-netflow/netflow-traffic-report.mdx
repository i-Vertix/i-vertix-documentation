The *Traffic Report* can give you a quick overview, what is going on in your network and who are your top talkers.
The age of the data that can be displayed depends on the retention settings. By default the data is stored for 180 days.

You can choose between a pre-defined period or select a custom time range. Also the latest caputred data is available in this view.
