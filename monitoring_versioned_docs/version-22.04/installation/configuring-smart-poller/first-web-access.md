# First access to the web console

Once the license is activated, you can access the Central Manager web console.

Open your browser (see [Compatibility](../before-you-start/compatibility.md)) and enter the Central Manager IP Address previously configured (see [Network configuration](../Setup-Startup-Central-Poller/network-configuration.md)).

>Note: the Smart Poller does not have a web user interface.

You can log in using the default credentials:
1) Username: **admin**
2) Password: **password**
