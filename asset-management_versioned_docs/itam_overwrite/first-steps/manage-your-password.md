# Manage your password

To change your password visit [user preferences](../first-steps/preferences.md).

![User Preferences](../assets/first-steps/images/user_preferences.png)

1) Click on the top right icon on any page
2) Select `My Settings`

Fill the `Password` field and the `Password Confirmation` field.
Then, click save.

The administrator can disable this feature, so the change password area does
not appear in this case.

In the event that the user has forgotten their password, the possibility
of resetting it is offered to them from the login page. The link is only
present if notifications are enabled.

Only users with an e-mail address defined in i-Vertix ITAM and not authenticating
via an external source (LDAP, mail server, etc.) can use this
functionality. Once the renewal request has been made by entering their
e-mail address, the user receives an e-mail providing them with a link
allowing them to reset their password.

Passwords must follow the defined security policy. A real-time check of
the entered password is then carried out.
