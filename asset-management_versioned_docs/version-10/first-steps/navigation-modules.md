# Navigate i-Vertix ITAM modules

The various functions of i-Vertix ITAM have been grouped into several modules,
built around similar contexts of use. The top bar of the interface
allows you to navigate between these modules:

- The [Assets module](/asset-management/modules/assets) provides access to the various inventoried materials,
- The
  [Assistance module](/asset-management/modules/assistance) allows you to create and monitor tickets, problems and
  changes; as well as see statistics.
- The
  [Management module](/asset-management/modules/management) allows you to manage contacts, suppliers, budgets,
  contracts and documents.
- The [Tools module](/asset-management/modules/tools) allows you to manage projects, notes, the knowledge base,
  reservations, RSS feeds and view reports.
- The
  [Administration module](/asset-management/modules/administration) allows you to administer users, groups, entities,
  profiles, rules and dictionaries. It also allows the management of the
  email queue.
- The
  [Setup module](/asset-management/modules/configuration) provides access to the general configuration options of
  i-Vertix ITAM: notifications, collectors, automatic tasks, authentication,
  plugins, external links, SLA, management of titles, components as well
  as control of the uniqueness of fields.

The menus presented vary according to the authorizations of the logged
in user. The navigation context is presented to the user in the
breadcrumb trail.

The combination of keys to associate with these shortcuts varies

In addition, since version 9.2, i-Vertix ITAM offers navigation with approximate
search (fuzzy) accessible from the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + `Alt` +
`G`. This will open a modal window allowing you to filter, via a search
field, all the menus of i-Vertix ITAM (all the levels are present, you have for
example access to the 3rd level such as the dropdowns or the
components).

In this window, additional shortcuts are available:

- `↑` and `↓` in order to navigate through the results
- `Enter` to change the active glpi page on the selected result
- `Esc` to close the window.
