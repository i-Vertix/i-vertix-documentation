**Management type:**

It is possible to manage displays either unitary or globally.

Unitary management corresponds to one display per computer while global
management make the printer a virtual global element that will be
connected to several computers.

Global management allows to limit the number of elements to manage when
these elements are not a strategic data in the assets management.

It is possible to use
[templates with displays](../../modules/overview/templates).

## The different tabs

### Connections

This tab allows to manage the direct connections between a computer and
its connected elements.

Direct connections represent the relation between different hardwares
linked either physically or virtually.

#### From a computer

The connection can be made toward one or several elements of type
display, printer, peripheral or phone. For each type of connected
object, its name, serial number and inventory number are displayed.

![List of connections](../../assets/modules/assets/images/connections_computer_list.png)

#### From an element other than a computer

To add a connection, select the computer in the drop-down list presented
at top of the table.

![List of connections](../../assets/modules/assets/images/connections_monitor_list.png)

If this case, the connection can only be made to a single computer. The
table will list the name of this computer as well as its serial and
inventory numbers.

:::info

The deletion of a connection can be made from the entry of each
connected hardware (tab *Connections*) via mass actions.

:::

:::info

Every deletion or addition of a connection is recorded in the history
of the computer.

:::

:::info

If using native inventory or third-party inventory tool, the
connections informations can be automatically imported and updated.

:::

### Management

Management of financial and administrative information, this information
is visible in the 'Management' tab on the computer's form.

![Management screen](../../assets/modules/tabs/images/management.png)

By default this management is disabled. It is possible to activate the
financial information on any type of object in the inventory by using
the link in the *Management* tab of the material detail.

![Enable management](../../assets/modules/tabs/images/management_enable.png)

:::info

It is possible to activate the administrative and financial
information from the massive actions on a set of elements (computer,
monitor, ...)

:::

:::info

It is possible to activate the administrative and financial
information as soon as an element is created. See "Enable default
administrative and financial information" option in Setup \> General
\> Asset tab.

:::

Financial information consists of the following items:

#### Lifecycle

- Order date
- Date of purchase
- Delivery date
- Date of implementation
- Date of last physical inventory
- Date of reform

#### Financial and administrative information

- Supplier: Third party who sold the equipment. See
  [Managing suppliers](../../modules/management/suppliers). Suppliers are managed from the menu **Management \>
  Suppliers**.
- Order number : number of the order of the equipment.
- Asset number.
- Invoice number: equipment invoice number.
- Delivery note: delivery note for the equipment.
- Value: cost of the equipment.
- Warranty extension value: cost of the warranty extension, but
  preferably use contracts.
- Account net value: this is the automatic calculation of the gross
  value of a piece of equipment minus the amount of depreciation.
- Type of depreciation: choice of the type of depreciation between
  linear and declining balance.
- Depreciation period: depreciation period expressed in years.
- Depreciation coefficient: coefficient applied to a straight-line
  depreciation type in order to obtain the values of the declining
  balance type. It is therefore only used if the type of depreciation is
  declining balance.
- TCO (value+amount of interventions): the total cost of ownership which
  includes all the constituent elements of an invoiced product.
- Budget: the budget on which this equipment was purchased See
  [Managing the budget](../../modules/management/budgets).
- Order date: date on which the material was ordered.
- Purchase date: date on which the equipment was purchased.
- Delivery date: date on which the equipment was delivered.
- Startup date: date on which the equipment was put into service.
- Date of last physical inventory: date of the last physical inventory
  of the equipment.
- Comments.
- Monthly TCO: TCO divided by the number of months between today's date
  and the date of purchase of the equipment.

#### Warranty information

- Warranty start date: date on which the warranty of the equipment
  starts

- Warranty information: text qualifying the warranty

- Warranty period: duration of the warranty expressed in months
      If a warranty start date and a warranty period are set, the
      information "Expires on" will appear with a date in red if it is
      earlier than the current date

All the dates defined can be managed automatically according to changes
in the status of the equipment. Some dates can also be copied from
another date. All this configuration is done by
\[entity\](administration_entity_delegation.dita).

#### Tips

i-Vertix ITAM allows you to configure a notification on the expiry of the
hardware warranty. This is configurable by entity in notification
management to define the models and recipients used and in
[the administration of entities](../../modules/administration/entities) to enable or disable this feature, define the default values
and anticipate the sending of the notification if necessary.

i-Vertix ITAM can perform a simple net book value calculation based on
straight-line or declining balance depreciation. To do so, a certain
amount of information (value, date, etc.) must be entered. The user must
also enter the date of the financial year the general configuration.

The display of financial information for each type of equipment depends
on the profile of the user logged in.

### Associated Contracts

The *Contracts* tab is used to show or add linked contracts.

![Contract display screen](../../assets/modules/tabs/images/contract.png)

For each associated contract, the name, number, contract type, supplier,
start date and initial duration of the contract are listed. In the last
field, the end date of the contract is also shown with a red display if
the date is earlier than the current date.

Refer to
[contract management](../../modules/management/contract) for more information.

### Documents

Additional information is stored in the form of external documents which
are files uploaded into i-Vertix ITAM. In the *Documents* tab, documents can be
associated and unlinked with the selected item. The
[management of the documents themselves](../../modules/management/documents) is dealt with in another chapter.

It is also possible to quickly create a document via this tab by
specifying the desired file and optionally the field in which the new
document is to be placed. The name of the created document will be based
on the name of the added file.

![Document creation screen](../../assets/modules/tabs/images/documents.png)

:::info

When you delete a document from this tab via mass actions, you only
remove the link between the object and the document; the document
itself is still present.

:::

### Tickets

The *Tickets* tab is used to create a ticket associated with the current
object. It also lists the tickets already linked to the object.

![Image of the ticket list](../../assets/modules/tabs/images/tickets.png)
