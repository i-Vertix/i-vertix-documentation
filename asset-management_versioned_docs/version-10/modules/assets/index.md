# Assets

The i-Vertix ITAM Asset module is used to manage all the assets that are part of
your IT infrastructure, whether they have been added manually or brought
up by automatic inventory

## Asset management in i-Vertix ITAM

In order to manage hardwares and software of an IT infrastructure, i-Vertix ITAM
allows natively to list all the assets that are used inside the managed
organization.

However, it is possible to automate information pushing from the assets
thanks to the native inventory and i-Vertix ITAM Agent.

More information on the i-Vertix ITAM Agent can be found in its dedicated
[documentation](https://glpi-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

:::info

if you were using Fusion Inventory on your previous versions, this
plugin is no longer supported. We advise you to install the i-Vertix ITAM
Inventory plugin for tasks such as deploying packages, SNMP inventory
and data collection, or to use i-Vertix ITAM's native inventory for simple
reporting of your equipment.
