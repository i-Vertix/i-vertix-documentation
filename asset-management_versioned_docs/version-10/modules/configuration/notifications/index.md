# Notifications

i-Vertix ITAM has a notification feature that allows it to send messages
following an event in the application, to users via email, browser
notifications, and other methods (expandable by plugins).

i-Vertix ITAM comes with notification definitions pre-defined and they can be
used out of the box right away after enabling notifications.

To do this, you must activate the **Enable followup** option then
**Enable followup via email** or **Browser followups from browser** to
display the settings menu:

- [Templates](/asset-management/modules/configuration/notifications/templates)
- [Template Example](/asset-management/modules/configuration/notifications/template_example)
- [Definitions](/asset-management/modules/configuration/notifications/definitions)
- [Email Notifications](/asset-management/modules/configuration/notifications/email_notifications)
- [Alarm Options](/asset-management/modules/configuration/notifications/alarm_options)

:::info

Notifications work as follows (*e.g.: ticket creation notified by
email*):

1.  The ticket is created in i-Vertix ITAM.
2.  i-Vertix ITAM looks for notifications of the "\*\*ticket creation\*\*"
event in the ticket entity (otherwise in the parent entities).
3.  i-Vertix ITAM builds the list of recipients according to the settings.
4.  For each recipient, i-Vertix ITAM generates the mail in the language of the
user if the translation exists, otherwise it is the "\*\*Default
translation\*\*".
5.  The emails are placed in **Administration \> Notification queue**
waiting to be sent by the automatic task `queuednotification`.

:::warning

When new notifications are added to i-Vertix ITAM through an update, they are
enabled by default.
