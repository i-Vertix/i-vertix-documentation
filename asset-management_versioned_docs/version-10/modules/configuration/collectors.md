# Receivers

Receivers configuration can be reached from [Configuration -\> Receivers
] menu.

A receiver allow to import emails from a mailbox ans turn them into i-Vertix ITAM
tickets. A [routing mechanism](collectors_rules) will bring them to the destination entity.

A receiver is associated with an email address. It is possible to add as
many receivers as you want. Of course, the more receivers you configure,
the more import will take time.

To declare a new collector, you will have to provide a server name, as
well as connection options (IMAP or POP, SSL, TLS, certificate
validation). It is possible to limit the maximum size for attachments
(no import, or from 1 to 100 Mio). This configuration value is inherited
from the main configuration ([Setup -\> General -\>
Assistance]) A configuration option permit to switch tickets
creation date between import date or email date.

Optionally, you can set an archive directory in the mailbox where
imported and refused emails will be stored.

Receivers that have errors will be indicated above the list. In that
case, number of successive errors will be displayed in collector
configuration form.

Once the form validated, you can test connection and messages retrieving
by using the dedicated button.

An automatic action will do the import on configured receivers ; time
between two executions can be configured in automated task form.

Another automatic action will send notifications when any collector
repetitively fails to import emails. See [notifications configuration
\<modules/configuration/notifications\>].

:::warning

Answers to emails generated from i-Vertix ITAM for tickets are cleaned when
importing from a collector: all content between up and bottom tags
will be removed. Answers must be done before or after original
message.

## Blacklists

Receivers can use a blacklist mechanism in order to remove recurrent but
useless contents, like email signatures.

Blacklist can also prevent emails to be imported from specific email
addresses; this can be useful to prevent spam, or to handle emails
aliases.

## Rules for assigning a ticket opened via a receiver 

i-Vertix ITAM implements a mechanism for routing tickets opened by email, in
order to create them in the right entity. This is based on the rules
engine.

:::info

if notifications are not enabled in the configuration, the menu does
not appear in **Rules**.

:::

Available criteria are:

- name of receiver
- requester
- email domain, whether it is known or not
- email headers: `auto_submitted`, `from`, `in_reply_to`, `received`,
  `subject`, `to`, `X-Auto-Response-Suppress`, `X-priority`,
  `X-UCE-Status`
- email body.

Finally, there is a third type of criteria which operates on data
specific to the user or to the configuration of the entities:

- **known email domain**: checks that the email domain of the email sent
  corresponds to a domain entered in an entity. This criterion makes it
  possible to eliminate, for example, all spam, i.e. messages not coming
  from authorized domains
- **user: group**: checks that the i-Vertix ITAM user associated with the
  sender's e-mail address belongs to a given group;
- **user with profile**: the user has a given profile;
- **user with single profile**: the user has one and only one profile in
  i-Vertix ITAM. If the profile is associated with several different entities,
  then the one that is defined as the default entity in the user's
  personalization options will be the entity of the ticket. If none is
  defined in the preferences, the rule does not match
- **user with the profile only once**: the user has a given profile only
  once: it does not have the profile assigned on several separate
  entities.

The actions are either the refusal of the ticket (with or without
notification of the refusal to the issuer), or the import into an entity
(manual, from TAG, from mail domain, from user profile).

:::warning

The engine stops at the first matching rule.
