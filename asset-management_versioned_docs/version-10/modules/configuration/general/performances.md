# Performances

Displays information related to the different caching systems used by
i-Vertix ITAM including:

- PHP opcode cache - Improves performance of the PHP engine when
  interpreting the different PHP files.
- User data cache - General-purpose cache used by i-Vertix ITAM.
- Translation cache - Cache used for translations to avoid having to
  read the locale files for all translations.

You also have the ability to clear the different caches from here.

The cache systems for user data and translations can be changed or
configured from the [cache:configure] CLI command.
