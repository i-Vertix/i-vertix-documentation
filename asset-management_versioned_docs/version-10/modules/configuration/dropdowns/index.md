# Dropdowns

Some dropdown lists can be configured in i-Vertix ITAM including but not limited
to:

- Locations
- Status of items
- Ticket categories
- Software names
- Manufacturers

Some of the dropdowns have some default values added during the
installation of i-Vertix ITAM when they may benefit many users. For example, i-Vertix ITAM
defines multiple files system formats by default.

The list of dropdown types may vary depending on the user's current
profile.

The dropdown options can be translated into multiple languages, however
this feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled in [Setup \>
General \> General setup]. This will add a new tab in the
dropdown form to manage the translations.

Some of the dropdowns are simple, flat lists while others can be
organized into a tree structure by defining their parent option.

All dropdown options can be given a comment that will show in other i-Vertix ITAM
forms by hovering over the **Help** icon next to the dropdown.

The types of dropdowns that can be associated with specific entities
will show a "stack" icon (Same as the Entity menu item).
