#### Lifecycle

- Order date
- Date of purchase
- Delivery date
- Date of implementation
- Date of last physical inventory
- Date of reform

#### Financial and administrative information

- Supplier: Third party who sold the equipment. See

  Suppliers**.
- Order number : number of the order of the equipment.
- Asset number.
- Invoice number: equipment invoice number.
- Delivery note: delivery note for the equipment.
- Value: cost of the equipment.
- Warranty extension value: cost of the warranty extension, but
  preferably use contracts.
- Account net value: this is the automatic calculation of the gross
  value of a piece of equipment minus the amount of depreciation.
- Type of depreciation: choice of the type of depreciation between
  linear and declining balance.
- Depreciation period: depreciation period expressed in years.
- Depreciation coefficient: coefficient applied to a straight-line
  depreciation type in order to obtain the values of the declining
  balance type. It is therefore only used if the type of depreciation is
  declining balance.
- TCO (value+amount of interventions): the total cost of ownership which
  includes all the constituent elements of an invoiced product.
- Budget: the budget on which this equipment was purchased See
  [Managing the budget](../management/budgets).
- Order date: date on which the material was ordered.

  and the date of purchase of the equipment.

#### Warranty information

- Warranty start date: date on which the warranty of the equipment
  starts

- Warranty information: text qualifying the warranty

- Warranty period: duration of the warranty expressed in months

  :   If a warranty start date and a warranty period are set, the
      information "Expires on" will appear with a date in red if it is
      earlier than the current date

All the dates defined can be managed automatically according to changes
in the status of the equipment. Some dates can also be copied from
another date. All this configuration is done by
\[entity\](administration_entity_delegation.dita).

#### Tips

i-Vertix ITAM allows you to configure a notification on the expiry of the
hardware warranty. This is configurable by entity in
[notification management](configure_notifications) to define the models and recipients used and in
[the administration of entities](/asset-management/modules/administration/entities) to enable or disable this feature, define the default values
and anticipate the sending of the notification if necessary.

i-Vertix ITAM can perform a simple net book value calculation based on
straight-line or declining balance depreciation. To do so, a certain
amount of information (value, date, etc.) must be entered. The user must
also enter the date of the financial year the general configuration.

The display of financial information for each type of equipment depends
on the profile of the user logged in.
