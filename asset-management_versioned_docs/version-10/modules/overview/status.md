# Status in i-Vertix ITAM, specific view

Status information is frequently used to sort hardware that is disposed,
available, assigned... It is possible to create new status values
specific to the information system managed by i-Vertix ITAM.

Defining new status and the object types they will be used for is under
i-Vertix ITAM administrator's responsibility, see
[dropdown configuration](/asset-management/modules/configuration/dropdowns). These defined status can be recursive, in order to ease
management.

Modifying an element's status can be done either from the element's
form or using mass actions.

A report can display a summary of statuses sorted by asset types. Global
search on inventory allows to query inventory elements by status.
