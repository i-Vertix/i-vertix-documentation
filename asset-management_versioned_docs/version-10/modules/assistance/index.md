# Assistance

Assistance module allows users to create, follow and process tickets.
Plannings, statistics and recurrent tickets are also available.

Depending on profile permissions, it is possible as well to create,
follow and process problems and changes.

i-Vertix ITAM assistance module is compliant with ITIL best practises guide and
integrates therefore some fields normalization. However, following ITIL
best practises is recommanded but not mandatory and it is perfectly
feasible, thanks to module's flexibility, to implement an assistance
service tailored to the organization's needs.

Tickets, Changes and Problems can be viewed globally in a Kanban view.
For more information about the Kanban feature, please refer to the
[full documentation](../../modules/overview/kanban.md).
