# Debugging information

If you have [Debug] mode enabled in your preferences, a
*Debug* tab will appear before the *All* tab. This tab offers
information to help you resolve an issue.

For example, for a computer, you have one or more tables depending on
the affected object (financial information, reservations...) listing
the notifications that will be triggered on this computer with:

- Triggering event
- Recipient(s)
- Notification model used
- Recipient(s) email address
