# Authorizations

Authorizations correspond to the rights and permissions assigned to
users or groups to access different features or modules. They allow you
to precisely define who can view, create, modify, or delete data
(tickets, assets, budgets, etc.). Authorizations are managed via
profiles and ensure security, confidentiality, and the proper
distribution of responsibilities in the management of the i-Vertix ITAM
environment.

**Information on abbreviations**

You will be able to see in the "\*profiles\*" section as in the
example above the letters R and D.

**R** = Recursive

This means that the profile has access to all attached child entities.

**D** = Dynamic

This means that the authorization was added through an authorization
rule. If this rule is modified, the authorization will also be changed
the next time the user logs in.
