# Asset type

:::info

This field is used in the same way for many i-Vertix ITAM objects (printer,
computer, peripheral, etc.). We'll use computers as an example, but
the process is identical for other i-Vertix ITAM objects.

The type of computer allows you to specify whether the machine is a
laptop, a server, a workstation, etc. There is no predefined type; the
different types must be created.
